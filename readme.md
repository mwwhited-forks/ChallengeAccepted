# Coding Challenges

## Summary

This is a set of coding challenges.  

Fork this repository and then code then in any language, runtime and platform you like.  

These are intended for fun and practice.  I suggest you even try them in multiple languages.

Please feel free to fork this repository and try your own entries.  If you have suggestions 
for challenges please feel free to post them as issues.  

## Open for all

Apparently you can't fork your own projects here on github so I have to juggle remotes for
my own entries... but you are welcome to explore them at [ChallengeAccepted](https://github.com/mwwhited-forks/ChallengeAccepted)
