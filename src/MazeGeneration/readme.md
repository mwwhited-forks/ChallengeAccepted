# Maze Generator

## Summary

Generate a random maze structure and render it in a simple text‑based format. Mazes consist of 
pathways and walls arranged so that there is a unique route (or multiple routes) from a start 
to a finish.

## Challenge

- Choose a maze generation algorithm (e.g., Depth‑First Search backtracker, Kruskal’s, Prim’s)
- Represent the maze as a grid of cells, each with walls on its sides
- Carve passages between cells according to your chosen algorithm
- Render the final maze in text form
- Allow the user to specify the maze dimensions (width × height)

## Bonus

- Support different output styles (ASCII art, Unicode box‑drawing characters)
- Implement a solver that finds and marks the path from entrance to exit
- Animate the maze generation step‑by‑step in the console or a simple GUI
- Allow generating mazes with multiple entry and exit points
