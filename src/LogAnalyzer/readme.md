# Log Analyzer

## Summary

Many systems generate logs that need parsing and analysis to extract useful insights.

## Challenge

- Parse a text log file and extract fields such as timestamp, level, and message
- Generate a summary of occurrences per log level (e.g., ERROR, WARN, INFO)

## Bonus

- Detect repeated error messages or anomalies
- Generate a timeline chart of error frequency
