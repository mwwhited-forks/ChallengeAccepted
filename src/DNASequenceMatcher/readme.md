# DNA Sequence Matcher

## Summary

DNA and RNA sequences often require searching for genetic patterns that can include ambiguity.

## Challenge

- Match sequences where:

  - `A`, `C`, `T`, `G` are literal
  - `N` matches any nucleotide

## Bonus

- Implement reverse-complement search
- Support IUPAC ambiguity codes
