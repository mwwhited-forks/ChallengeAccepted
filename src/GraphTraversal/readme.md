## Summary

Graphs are data structures representing nodes and connections (edges) between them. 
They are used in routing, social networks, and relationship modeling.

## Challenge

- Represent a graph using an adjacency list or matrix
- Implement basic traversal algorithms:

  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Bonus

- Detect cycles in a directed graph
- Count connected components
