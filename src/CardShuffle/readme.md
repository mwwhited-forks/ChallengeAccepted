# Card Shuffle

## Summary

Many games are based around a deck of cards. A common routine is shuffling that deck into a random order before dealing or playing hands.

## Challenge

- Write a method that takes an ordered deck of cards and shuffles them into a random order
- The number of cards and sets is up to you, but a standard deck includes:

  - 4 suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs
  - 13 cards per suit: 2–10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace

## Bonus

- After shuffling the deck, deal out the cards into multiple hands like you would for Blackjack or another poker game
