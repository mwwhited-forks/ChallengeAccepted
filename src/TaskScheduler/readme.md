# Task Scheduler

## Summary

A task scheduler runs tasks (jobs) at specified times or intervals, commonly used in 
operating systems, automation, and application workflows.

## Challenge

- Create a scheduler that can:

  - Schedule tasks to run once at a specific time
  - Schedule recurring tasks at fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes)
  - Cancel scheduled tasks

## Bonus

- Support different types of tasks (functions, shell commands, etc.)
- Allow tasks to have priorities affecting execution order
- Provide status reporting of scheduled and running tasks
