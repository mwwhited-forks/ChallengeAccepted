# Amortization Calculator

## Summary

Amortization is the process of spreading out a loan into a series of fixed payments over time. Each payment includes both principal and interest, gradually reducing the balance until the loan is paid off.

Create a simple program that generates an amortization schedule based on:

- Starting balance
- Interest rate
- Fixed payment amount

You can use any programming language or interface to display the schedule.

## Requirements

- Input:

  - `starting_balance`
  - `annual_interest_rate` (as a percentage)
  - `monthly_payment`

- Output:

  - A schedule showing, for each month:

    - Payment number
    - Interest paid
    - Principal paid
    - Remaining balance

- The schedule should continue until the loan is fully paid off.
