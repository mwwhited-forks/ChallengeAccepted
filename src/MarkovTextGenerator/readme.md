# Markov Text Generator

## Summary

Markov chains are a statistical model where the next state depends only
on the current state. They're useful in text generation and predictive modeling.

## Challenge

- Use a corpus of text to generate a first-order Markov model
- Randomly generate new text that mimics the style of the input

## Bonus

- Extend to second or third-order chains
- Allow seeding with a starting word or phrase
