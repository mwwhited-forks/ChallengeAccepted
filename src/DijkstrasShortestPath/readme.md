# Dijkstra's Shortest Path

## Summary

Dijkstra's algorithm is a method to determine the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.

## Challenge

- Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for a weighted graph
- Output the shortest path and cost between a start and end node

## Bonus

- Visualize the algorithm step by step with text or graphics
