# Regular Expression Engine (Mini)

## Summary

Regular expressions are powerful tools for describing and recognizing string patterns.

## Challenge

- Implement a basic regex engine supporting:

  - `.` – any character
  - `*` – zero or more of the previous character
  - `^` and `$` for anchors

## Bonus

- Add support for character classes: `[abc]`, `[a-z]`
- Add support for `+`, `?`, and grouping `()`
