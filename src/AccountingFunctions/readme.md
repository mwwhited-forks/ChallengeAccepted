# Accounting Functions

## Summary

Write functions to perform common accounting calculations. These are used in finance to 
understand loan payments, interest accumulation, and investment growth.

You can use any programming language and interface you like—command-line, GUI, web-based, 
etc.

## Functions

### Calculated Payment

Calculate the regular payment needed to pay off a loan.

`Payment = (Present Value * Periodic Rate) / (1 - (1 + Periodic Rate) ^ -Number of Periods)`

### Future Value

`Future Value = Present Value * ((1 + Periodic Rate) ^ Number of Periods)`
