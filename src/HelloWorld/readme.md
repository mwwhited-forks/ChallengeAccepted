# Hello World

## Summary

The “Hello World” program is the simplest program in any language, traditionally used to introduce beginners 
to syntax and environment setup. It outputs the phrase “Hello, World!” to demonstrate the basic structure of
a working program.

## Challenge

- Write a program in any programming language that prints `Hello, World!`
- Use an interface of your choice:

  - Command‑line/console
  - GUI window
  - Web page
  - Mobile app

- Ensure your code follows the conventions of the chosen language (e.g., proper function or class structure)

## Bonus

- Modify the program to accept a user’s name as input and print `Hello, <Name>!`
- Add a command‑line flag (e.g., `--shout`) that outputs the greeting in uppercase
- Build a small UI where the user can type their name into a text field and see the greeting displayed dynamically
