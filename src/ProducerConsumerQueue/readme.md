# Producer-Consumer Queue

## Summary

The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic example of synchronization using queues.

## Challenge

- Implement a thread-safe queue with one or more producers adding data and one or more consumers processing data.
- Handle synchronization to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

## Bonus

- Add support for multiple consumer/producer threads.
- Implement bounded buffer with blocking when full or empty.
