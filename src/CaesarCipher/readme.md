# Caesar Cipher

## Summary

A Caesar cipher is a simple subtition cipher based on shifting a given alphabete by an offset.

The cipher can be decoded by using the negative offset of the cipher.

## Challenge

* Write a method that generates the encoded text based on a given input
* If the input is not a number then use the alphabet to determine the offset
* You may either ignore or exclude values not in your defined alphabet. 

## Bonus

A more complex variation on a Caesar cipher is the Vigenère cipher.  This uses a keyword for
multiple offsets by rotating though the keywork for each letter changing the substitution alphabet
per letter.

* Use your Caesar cipher as a base to create a Vigenère cipher
