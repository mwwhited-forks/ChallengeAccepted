# Procedural Generation

## Summary

Procedural Generation is a technique to use algorithmiths to created items. This is often used to generate maps
models (such as trees), repeating textures and much more.

One of the advantages is you can have a deterministic world without having to manually define and store the entire 
world. This can save development time, storage space and over all processing power with you game or application.
