# Procedural Generation

## Summary

Procedural Generation uses algorithms to automatically create content—such as maps, models (e.g., trees),
textures, and more—rather than authoring every asset by hand. This enables deterministic worlds (given a 
seed), saves storage space, and can dramatically reduce development time and runtime memory usage.

## Challenge

- Design a system that, given a seed value, generates one or more of the following:

  - **Terrain** (heightmaps, cave systems)
  - **Vegetation** (trees, grass patches)
  - **Textures** (noise‑based patterns or repeating tiles)
  - **Level layouts** (dungeons, road networks)
- Allow the user to specify parameters such as:

  - Seed value
  - Scale or detail level
  - Distribution rules (e.g., tree density, cave frequency)
- Ensure that using the same seed and parameters always reproduces the same output
- Provide at least one way to visualize or export the generated content (e.g., ASCII map, image file, simple 3D view)

## Bonus

- Combine multiple techniques (e.g., Perlin noise terrain + L‑system trees + cellular automata caves)
- Implement parameter presets (e.g., “mountainous,” “forest,” “cavern”)
- Add an interactive UI to tweak parameters in real time and regenerate
- Save and load parameters and seeds for sharing specific worlds
