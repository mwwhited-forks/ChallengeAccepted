# Simple Pattern Matcher

## Summary

Pattern matching allows you to search and compare strings using specific rules or wildcards.

## Challenge

- Implement a function that supports simple wildcard matching:

  - `*` matches any number of characters
  - `?` matches exactly one character

## Bonus

- Return all matching words from a list of candidates
- Handle escaping of wildcard characters (e.g., `\*` means literal `*`)
